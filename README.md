#Getting Started
I've prepared an easy way to run this project locally:

1. Clone this repository:
```
$ git@github.com:viniciuschan/logistics-api.git
```
2. In the working directory, you can enjoy a bunch of Makefile useful commands:
```
$ make run
```
3. As soon as you get your containers ON, you must migrate the data structure:
```
$ make migrate
```
4. I've prepared a fixture file to load initial items for test purposes:
```
$ make loaddata
```
5. Finally, you can check test cases by running the following command:
```
$ make test
```

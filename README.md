Logistics API
=============
##### API Rest to deal with a logistics network and it's best routes
###### Author: Vin√≠cius Chan


#### Before getting started, we must install some dependencies:

| Dependency | Download Link |
| ------ | ------ |
| Docker | https://www.docker.com/ |
| Docker-Compose | https://docs.docker.com/compose/ |
| Django Rest Framework 3.9 | http://www.django-rest-framework.org |
| Django 2.1.8 | https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/releases/2.1/ |
| Python 3.6.8 | https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/ |
| NetworkX | https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/install.html |


# Getting Started

I prepared an easy way to run this project locally:

1. Clone this repository:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:viniciuschan/logistics-api.git
```
2. In the correct working directory, you can enjoy a bunch of Makefile useful commands:
```
$ make run
```
3. As soon as you get your containers ON, you must migrate the data structure:
```
$ make migrate
```
4. I prepared a fixture file to load initial items for test purposes:
```
$ make loaddata
```
5. Finally, you can check all test cases by running the following command:
```
$ make test
```

# About Tech



### Docker

I usually like to prepare my environment before starting projects. It's helpful to avoid any S.O. dependency problems. And it's very useful to create containers with Docker + Docker-Compose to work with local environment.


### Docker-Compose

Docker + Docker compose is my favorite combination to work with isolated local environment. Makefile can also be very helpful during project development. It allows me to create a lot of alias to access and manipulate my containers.


### Travis

This is the continuous integration delivery tool that I have more familiar with.

I strongly believe that tests were made to help us during the project development.

Therefore, it is very important to make test statuses available, which also allows creating a sense of urgency for those involved in the project. If tests are not successfully integrated, software health is at risk.


### Postgres

It was my first experience with postgres and I liked it pretty much.

My motivation to use this database was because I would like to try it's [JSON Type field](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/datatype-json.html).


### Django

Well, it's my favorite python web framework. I've been working with Django since 2017, December. It offers a lot of helpful and useful tools which allows us to deliver projects and Rest API's very quickly with it's built-in modules.


### Django Rest Framework

I am very familiar working with Django Restless framework. But, for sure, I prefer DRF.
This is another framework which I insist on using whenever possible. Django + Django Rest Framework is a very powerful tool which brings productivity to the project. Also, I am not a fan of reinventing the wheel. If there is a tool that works well, why not use it?


### NetworkX

This library literally saved my ass. lol

I almost did not have to worry about the meaning of graph theory and it's complexities.

It was another very good lesson for me in this project.

Again, if there is a tool that works fine, why not use it?


### Trello

I organized my workflow using Trello.

It is an efficient source tool to deal with work flow.

I also know Asana and Jira, but Trello is my favorite, it is simple and works fine for small projects.


=============

### Final considerations:

I gained valuable experience working on this project. It was very enriching for me.

I hope you like it! =)
